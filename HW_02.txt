Practices:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a method that get array of strings and return the longest string 
2. Write a method that get array of numbers and return a string of all numbers seperated with uderscore (example:2_3_4)
3. Write a method that read 2 numbers from the user and operator string (+/-/*/)
   the method name it Calculate will print the result of the operation:
   int Calculate(int num1,int num2, string operator)
4. Write a method name it DitanceFromAvg 
  that get 2 parameters array of numbers (numbers) and a number (distanceAvg):
  List<int> DitanceFromAvg(int[] numbers,distanceAvg)
  the method will return a dynamic array of all numbers 
  that the distance from avg is less then the value of distanceAvg
5. write a method that read from user string values dynamically (use List) untill
  it user input "exit"
  the method will 
  print all strings in the list as uppercase from last to first
  print how many strings in the list
 6. write a method  that get list of numbers and print all numbers sorted (search google)
 7. write a method that read integers values into List
   each value must be between 0-100 
   if it is not between 0-100 the value should not added to the list
   and user should read the number again
8. write a method that get 2 parameters :
 -   list of strings (strings)  
 -   string (valuetoremove):              
   List<string> RemoveFromList(List<string> strings,string valuetoremove)     
 -   the method will remove all apperences of valuetoremove from the list
     and return a list witout the valurs removed
9.   wtite a method that get decimal list of numbers 
    - the method will remove all numbers that are bigget then average
    - it will print the removed indexes
    - it will return the new list (after removing the numbers biggest then avg)
